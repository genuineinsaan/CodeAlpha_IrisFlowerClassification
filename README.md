# CodeAlpha_IrisFlowerClassification

## 🌸 Project: Iris Flower Classification

This project is part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**. The goal of this task was to build a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into three species — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on their petal and sepal measurements.

---

## 🚀 Task Overview

**Task Objectives:**
- Use the Iris dataset to classify flower species
- Build a machine learning model using `Scikit-learn`
- Evaluate the model using test data
- Understand basic classification techniques

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python 3.13**
- **Pandas**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**

---

## 📁 Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Iris.csv` | Dataset used (from Kaggle) |
| `iris_classification.py` | Main source code for training & testing the model |
| `README.md` | Project description file |

---

## 🔍 How It Works

1. Load the dataset using `pandas`
2. Preprocess the data (remove ID column, encode labels)
3. Split data into training and testing sets
4. Train a `RandomForestClassifier`
5. Predict and evaluate using accuracy & classification report
6. Visualize using Seaborn `pairplot`

---

## 🎯 Output

- Achieved high accuracy (>95%) on test data
- Successfully classified all 3 Iris species
- Visualized the dataset to understand feature separation
